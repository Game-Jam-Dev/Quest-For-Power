  - speakerName: Arkanos
    dialog: Varian, what is the meaning of this? Why are you sitting on my throne?
  - speakerName: Varian
    dialog: Oh, Arkanos, you've finally arrived to witness the beginning of your
      end.
  - speakerName: Arkanos
    dialog: My end? You dare threaten me, Varian? You must be out of your mind.
  - speakerName: Varian
    dialog: Oh, I assure you, I have never been more in control of my mind. It is
      time for a new ruler, one who will bring prosperity and justice to these lands.
  - speakerName: Arkanos
    dialog: Prosperity and justice? Those are mere delusions of the weak. Power and
      domination are the true keys to ruling this realm.
  - speakerName: Varian
    dialog: Your reign of tyranny has brought nothing but suffering to our people.
      Your lust for power has blinded you to the cries of the innocent.
  - speakerName: Arkanos
    dialog: You have become a fool, Varian! I will not let your foolish ideals stand
      in the way of my ambitions.
  - speakerName: Varian
    dialog: Then so be it. I stand here not as your general, but as the liberator
      of this realm.
